# import-local
UNIX scripts for local filesystem import

These scripts are designed to import data from an external volume (e.g. CD, external drive, etc) onto a local computer. It assumes the data will be stored in DICOM format, following BIDS structure (i.e. in /sourcedata )

In order to use the script, save the script into your < code > directory. Use `chmod 777 import` to make script executable. 

To run script:

```
cd code
./import
```
